\##Section 1

Here we examine the size and composition of the main database of
biomolecular structures - the PDB.

Get a CSV file from the PDB databse and read it into R.

``` r
csv <- "Data Export Summary.csv"

pdbstats <- read.csv(csv, row.names = 1)
head(pdbstats)
```

> Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and
> Electron Microscopy.

My PDB stats frame has commas in it, making them characters. This may
cause problems:

``` r
#sum(pdbstats$X.ray)
```

We found the function of `gsub()` now we can figure out how it works.

``` r
x <- "22,000"
as.numeric(gsub(",","",x))
```

    [1] 22000

I can turn this into a function that I can use for every column in the
table.

``` r
commasum <- function(x){
  sum(as.numeric(gsub(",","",x)))
}

commasum(pdbstats$X.ray)
```

    [1] 182348

Applying the function to all of the column using the `apply()` function.

``` r
totals <- apply(pdbstats, 2, commasum)
head(totals)
```

               X.ray               EM              NMR Multiple.methods 
              182348            18817            14173              230 
             Neutron            Other 
                  79               37 

``` r
round(totals/totals["Total"]*100,2)
```

               X.ray               EM              NMR Multiple.methods 
               84.54             8.72             6.57             0.11 
             Neutron            Other            Total 
                0.04             0.02           100.00 

84.54 are with X ray and 8.72% are due to EM.

> Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

``` r
round(as.numeric(gsub(",","",pdbstats[1,7]))/totals["Total"]*100,2)
```

    Total 
    86.65 

The proportion of PDB that are protein is 86.65%.

``` r
(215684/249751891 * 100)
```

    [1] 0.08635931

The amount of publicly available structures.

## Visualization

We will learn the basics of Mol\*. We will play with PDB code 1HSG

> Q4: Water molecules normally have 3 atoms. Why do we see just one atom
> per water molecule in this structure?

We only see one atom per water molecule because Hydrogen is so small
that it is not picked up by the resultion of the stick and ball.

> Q5: There is a critical “conserved” water molecule in the binding
> site. Can you identify this water molecule? What residue number does
> this water molecule have

The water molecule is HOH 308.

Here we will do a Normal Model Analysis(NMA) to predict functional
motions of a kinase protein

``` r
adk <- read.pdb("6s36")
```

      Note: Accessing on-line PDB file
       PDB has ALT records, taking A only, rm.alt=TRUE

Then I can open this file in Mol\*…
