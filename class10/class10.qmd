##Section 1

Here we examine the size and composition of the main database of biomolecular structures - the PDB.

Get a CSV file from the PDB databse and read it into R.

```{r}
csv <- "Data Export Summary.csv"

pdbstats <- read.csv(csv, row.names = 1)
head(pdbstats)
```

> Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.

My PDB stats frame has commas in it, making them characters. This may cause problems:

```{r}
#sum(pdbstats$X.ray)
```

We found the function of `gsub()` now we can figure out how it works.

```{r}
x <- "22,000"
as.numeric(gsub(",","",x))
```

I can turn this into a function that I can use for every column in the table.

```{r}
commasum <- function(x){
  sum(as.numeric(gsub(",","",x)))
}

commasum(pdbstats$X.ray)
```

Applying the function to all of the column using the `apply()` function.

```{r}
totals <- apply(pdbstats, 2, commasum)
head(totals)
```

```{r}
round(totals/totals["Total"]*100,2)
```

84.54 are with X ray and 8.72% are due to EM.

> Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

```{r}
round(as.numeric(gsub(",","",pdbstats[1,7]))/totals["Total"]*100,2)
```

The proportion of PDB that are protein is 86.65%.

```{r}
(215684/249751891 * 100)
```

The amount of publicly available structures.

## Visualization

We will learn the basics of Mol\*. We will play with PDB code 1HSG

> Q4: Water molecules normally have 3 atoms. Why do we see just one atom per water molecule in this structure?

We only see one atom per water molecule because Hydrogen is so small that it is not picked up by the resultion of the stick and ball.

> Q5: There is a critical "conserved" water molecule in the binding site. Can you identify this water molecule? What residue number does this water molecule have

The water molecule is HOH 308.

## Back to R and working with PDB

Predict the dynamics of

```{r}
library(bio3d)

hiv <- read.pdb("1hsg")
hiv
```

```{r}
head(hiv$atom)
```
```{r}
pdbseq(hiv)
```
Here we will do a Normal Model Analysis(NMA) to predict functional motions of a kinase protein

```{r}
adk <- read.pdb("6s36")
adk
```
```{r}
modes <- nma(adk)
plot(modes)

```

Make a "movie" called a trajectory for off the predicted motions
```{r}
mktrj(modes, file= "adk_m7.pdb")
```

Then I can open this file in Mol*...
